## 0.10.1 2022-07-29


### Changed

- Make `DidYouMean` integration optional (via #86) (@jbourassa)

[Compare v0.10.0...v0.10.1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/compare/v0.10.0...v0.10.1)

## 0.10.0 2022-07-10

⚠️ Notice that dry-container no longer depends on dry-configurable. If you happen to rely on the advanced configurable functionality, add dry-configurable as a dependency and require it **before** requiring dry-container.

### Added

- Accept block given to `#merge` (via #83) (@timriley)

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Replace dep on dry-configurable with a simple `Configuration` mod (see #84 for more details) (@solnic)
- Raise KeyError for missing key, with DidYouMean integration (via #82) (@cllns)
- Wrap FrozenError, to state that the container itself is frozen (see #74) (@cllns)

[Compare v0.7.2...v0.8.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/compare/v0.7.2...v0.8.0)

## 0.7.2 2019-07-09


### Added

- `.resolve` accepts an optional fallback block, similar to how `Hash#fetch` works ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))
  ```ruby
  container.resolve('missing_key') { :fallback } # => :fallback
  ```
- `.decorate` can (again) work with static values. Also, it can take a block instead of `with` ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))
  ```ruby
  container.register('key', 'value')
  container.decorate('key') { |v| "<'#{v}'>" }
  container.resolve('key') # => "<'value'>"
  ```


[Compare v0.7.1...v0.7.2](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/compare/v0.7.1...v0.7.2)

## 0.7.1 2019-06-07


### Fixed

- Added `Mixin#dup` and `Mixin#clone`, now copies don't share underlying containers (flash-gordon)


[Compare v0.7.0...v0.7.1](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1)

## 0.7.0 2019-02-05


### Added

- Namespace DSL resolves keys relative to the current namespace, see the corresponding [changes](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/pull/47) ([yuszuv](https://github.com/yuszuv))
- Registered objects can be decorated with the following API ([igor-alexandrov](https://github.com/igor-alexandrov))

  ```ruby
  class CreateUser
    def call(params)
      # ...
    end
  end
  container.register('create_user') { CreateUser.new }
  container.decorate('create_user', with: ShinyLogger.new)

  # Now subsequent resolutions will return a wrapped object

  container.resolve('create_user')
  # => #<ShinyLogger @obj=#<CreateUser:0x...>]>
  ```
- Freezing a container now prevents further registrations ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))
- ## Internal
- Handling container items was generalized in [#34](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/pull/34) ([GabrielMalakias](https://github.com/GabrielMalakias))

### Fixed

- Symbols are now coerced to strings when resolving stubbed dependencies ([cthulhu666](https://github.com/cthulhu666))
- Stubbing keys not present in container will raise an error ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))

  This means after upgrading you may see errors like this
  ```
  ArgumentError (cannot stub "something" - no such key in container)
  ```
  Be sure you register dependencies before using them. The new behavior will likely save quite a bit of time when debugging ill-configured container setups.

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Now only Ruby 2.3 and above is supported ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))

[Compare v0.6.0...v0.7.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0)

## 0.6.0 2016-12-09


### Added

- `Dry::Container::Mixin#each` - provides a means of seeing what all is registered in the container ([jeremyf](https://github.com/jeremyf))

### Fixed

- Including mixin into a class with a custom initializer ([maltoe](https://github.com/maltoe))


[Compare v0.5.0...v0.6.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0)

## 0.5.0 2016-08-31


### Added

- `memoize` option to `#register` - memoizes items on first resolve ([ivoanjo](https://github.com/ivoanjo))

### Fixed
