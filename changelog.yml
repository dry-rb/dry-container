    `.resolve` accepts an optional fallback block, similar to how `Hash#fetch` works ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))
      ```ruby
      container.resolve('missing_key') { :fallback } # => :fallback
      ```
  - |-
    `.decorate` can (again) work with static values. Also, it can take a block instead of `with` ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))
      ```ruby
      container.register('key', 'value')
      container.decorate('key') { |v| "<'#{v}'>" }
      container.resolve('key') # => "<'value'>"
      ```
- version: 0.7.1
  date: '2019-06-07'
  fixed:
  - Added `Mixin#dup` and `Mixin#clone`, now copies don't share underlying containers
    (flash-gordon)
- version: 0.7.0
  date: '2019-02-05'
  changed:
  - "[BREAKING] Now only Ruby 2.3 and above is supported ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))"
  fixed:
  - Symbols are now coerced to strings when resolving stubbed dependencies ([cthulhu666](https://github.com/cthulhu666))
  - |-
    Stubbing keys not present in container will raise an error ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))

      This means after upgrading you may see errors like this
      ```
      ArgumentError (cannot stub "something" - no such key in container)
      ```
      Be sure you register dependencies before using them. The new behavior will likely save quite a bit of time when debugging ill-configured container setups.
  added:
  - Namespace DSL resolves keys relative to the current namespace, see the corresponding
    [changes](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/pull/47) ([yuszuv](https://github.com/yuszuv))
  - |-
    Registered objects can be decorated with the following API ([igor-alexandrov](https://github.com/igor-alexandrov))

      ```ruby
      class CreateUser
        def call(params)
          # ...
        end
      end
      container.register('create_user') { CreateUser.new }
      container.decorate('create_user', with: ShinyLogger.new)

      # Now subsequent resolutions will return a wrapped object

      container.resolve('create_user')
      # => #<ShinyLogger @obj=#<CreateUser:0x...>]>
      ```
  - Freezing a container now prevents further registrations ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))
  - "## Internal"
  - Handling container items was generalized in [#34](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/pull/34)
    ([GabrielMalakias](https://github.com/GabrielMalakias))

  date: '2016-12-09'

    in the container ([jeremyf](https://github.com/jeremyf))"
  fixed:

- version: 0.5.0
  date: '2016-08-31'
  added:
  - "`memoize` option to `#register` - memoizes items on first resolve ([ivoanjo](https://github.com/ivoanjo))"
