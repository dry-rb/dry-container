  summary: "⚠️ Notice that dry-container no longer depends on dry-configurable. If you happen to rely on the advanced configurable functionality, add dry-configurable as a dependency and require it **before** requiring dry-container."

      `.resolve` accepts an optional fallback block, similar to how `Hash#fetch` works ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))
        ```ruby
        container.resolve('missing_key') { :fallback } # => :fallback
        ```
    - |-
      `.decorate` can (again) work with static values. Also, it can take a block instead of `with` ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))
        ```ruby
        container.register('key', 'value')
        container.decorate('key') { |v| "<'#{v}'>" }
        container.resolve('key') # => "<'value'>"
        ```
- version: 0.7.1
  date: "2019-06-07"
  fixed:
    - Added `Mixin#dup` and `Mixin#clone`, now copies don't share underlying containers
      (flash-gordon)
- version: 0.7.0
  date: "2019-02-05"
  changed:
    - "[BREAKING] Now only Ruby 2.3 and above is supported ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))"
  fixed:
    - Symbols are now coerced to strings when resolving stubbed dependencies ([cthulhu666](https://github.com/cthulhu666))
    - |-
      Stubbing keys not present in container will raise an error ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))

        This means after upgrading you may see errors like this
        ```
        ArgumentError (cannot stub "something" - no such key in container)
        ```
        Be sure you register dependencies before using them. The new behavior will likely save quite a bit of time when debugging ill-configured container setups.
  added:
    - Namespace DSL resolves keys relative to the current namespace, see the corresponding
      [changes](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/pull/47) ([yuszuv](https://github.com/yuszuv))

      Registered objects can be decorated with the following API ([igor-alexandrov](https://github.com/igor-alexandrov))

        ```ruby
        class CreateUser
          def call(params)
            # ...
          end
        end
        container.register('create_user') { CreateUser.new }
        container.decorate('create_user', with: ShinyLogger.new)

        # Now subsequent resolutions will return a wrapped object

        container.resolve('create_user')
        # => #<ShinyLogger @obj=#<CreateUser:0x...>]>
        ```
    - Freezing a container now prevents further registrations ([flash-gordon](https://github.com/flash-gordon))
    - "## Internal"
    - Handling container items was generalized in [#34](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/pull/34)
